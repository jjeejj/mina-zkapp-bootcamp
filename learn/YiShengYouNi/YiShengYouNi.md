#### 自我介绍

Hello, my name is Henry Wei, and I am a seasoned Web2 front-end engineer with over a decade of experience in the field. My expertise lies in developing dynamic, user-focused applications using modern technologies such as React, TypeScript, and other essential tools in the web development ecosystem. Having participated in and led the development of numerous medium to large-scale projects, I take pride in delivering efficient and scalable solutions.

Recently, I’ve developed a strong interest in Web3 development. I’m eager to delve into the world of decentralized technologies, exploring blockchain, smart contracts, and the unique opportunities they bring to reshape the digital landscape. The prospect of building applications that leverage decentralization and innovation excites me, and I’m committed to learning the knowledge and skills needed to excel in this space.

Beyond my professional work, I have a deep passion for programming itself. For me, coding is not just a career but also a source of creativity and joy. I thrive on exploring new concepts, experimenting with cutting-edge technologies, and continually challenging myself to grow as a developer.

I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring the possibilities at the intersection of Web2 and Web3. Let’s build something extraordinary together!
